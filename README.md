# Test Automation Framework of Choice

*Cypress* is the test automation framework for end-to-end testing and *Visual Studio Code (VS Code)* as the IDE.
Alhough not as popular as Selenium, Cypress is rapidly gaining grounds as a worthy competitor and it's only a matter of time before it 
becomes the industry standard for web testing automation. Below are some key benefits of using Cypress.

* Ease of installation 
* Unlike Selenium, test execution happens in browser and drivers are unnecessary*
* Application JS objects are easily accessible since test code and application run in the same browser*
* Dashboard support for detailed reporting*
* Support for BDD and TDD testing*
* Auto-wait features make test execution more reliable*
* Superlative documentation with detailed explanation of commands and assertions, and best practices for test automation*
* Makes life easy for front-end developers with respect to writing unit tests*
